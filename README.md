# BattleShip

As part of [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com) curriculum I created a browser version of the classic tabletop game [BattleShip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)).

I was able to create this project using Test Driven Development principles powered by the testing platform [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

A live preview of the website is available [here](https://s111ew.github.io/odin-battleship/).
